Admin Panel Delete Functionality Prop Mismatch Bug Fix Testing - January 2025

CRITICAL BUG FIX VERIFICATION:
Testing the specific prop mismatch fix where delete modals expected `onDelete` prop 
but ContentManagement.jsx was passing `onConfirm`, causing delete buttons to not work.

FIXED COMPONENTS:
- DeletePublicationModal: Now receives onDelete prop correctly
- DeleteProjectModal: Now receives onDelete prop correctly  
- DeleteAchievementModal: Now receives onDelete prop correctly

USER REPORTED ERRORS (Should be resolved):
- "Error deleting publication. Please try again."
- "Failed to delete project. Please try again."
- "Error deleting achievement. Please try again."

Test Focus:
1. Verify prop names are correctly passed from ContentManagement to delete modals
2. Test delete button functionality in each modal
3. Verify handleConfirmDelete function is properly called
4. Test localStorage updates after successful deletions
5. Verify UI updates reflect successful deletions
