Critical Delete Functionality Debug Testing - January 2025

Testing the critical delete functionality for Publications, Projects, and Achievements
as reported by user that delete operations are still showing "Error deleting achievement. Please try again."

Test Requirements:
1. Delete Operations Testing - Publications, Projects, Achievements delete with detailed console output
2. Data Structure Validation - Verify ID types in localStorage data
3. Error Root Cause Identification - Identify exact point of failure using console logs
4. Context Functions Testing - Check if context functions are throwing errors
5. handleConfirmDelete Error Handling - Verify enhanced error handling and logging

Focus Areas:
- Enhanced Error Logging in handleConfirmDelete function
- Context Functions Enhancement with comprehensive error handling
- ID Type Consistency checking (string vs number comparison)
- Item existence validation before delete
- Detailed logging for debugging
