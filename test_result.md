# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

     - EditPersonModal এর handleSave function category parameter ছাড়া updatePerson call করতে পারছিল না
     - Person category mapping issue: display category to storage category conversion missing
  2. Missing Category Prop Fix: ContentManagement.jsx এ EditPersonModal এর জন্য category={editingCategory} prop added
  3. Category Mapping Fix: EditPersonModal এর handleSave function এ proper category mapping (Advisor->advisors, Team Member->teamMembers, Collaborator->collaborators) added
  4. Error Handling Enhancement: Invalid category handling এবং user feedback improvement
  
  ✅ ADMIN PANEL DELETE FUNCTIONALITY BUG FIX - JANUARY 2025:
  1. Root Cause Identified: Publications, Projects এবং Achievements delete functions এ async/await mismatch

     - Missing localStorage update in PeopleContext deletePerson function
     - Async/await mismatch: ContentManagement used await but deletePerson was not async
     - Category mapping issue: Display categories (Advisor, Team Member) not mapped to storage categories (advisors, teamMembers)
  2. Parameter Order Fix: Corrected ContentManagement.jsx to pass parameters in correct order (category, id)
  3. LocalStorage Update: Added proper localStorage save functionality in PeopleContext deletePerson
  4. Async Handling Fix: Removed await from non-async deletePerson call in ContentManagement
